        <b>Sign Out</b> – the process in healthcare where patients are handed over to the
        next person/team taking care of them. The term is inclusive to all healthcare professionals,
        not only to physicians; nurses, pharmacists, case-workers, social workers, and several others
        all practice the art of “signing out” to each other.<p>It’s a critical process. One must
        accurately summarize who/what/why the patient is here, keeping the sign out simple enough
        so that the next person isn’t flooded with irrelevant information, but thorough enough so
        the whole story can be well understood, and so good decisions can be made.</p>

        <b>Morning</b> sign outs are particularly interesting. All of the categoryActivity, labs,
        studies, and data that had occurred in the last 24 hours are assessed, and the plan for a
        new day is formulated. Most major medical decisions happen during the day, so the morning
        sign out is often the launching point for the rest of the day’s events.<p>As a society, there
        is a large divide between the world of medicine and science and that of the greater public.
        Often, the relationship between the two is strained and distrustful. This endeavor aims to
        bridge that divide.</p>
