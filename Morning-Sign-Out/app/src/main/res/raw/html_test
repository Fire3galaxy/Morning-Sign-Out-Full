<p>&#8220;It used to be a cornerstone of American life; it was how we knew sex was over before the female orgasm was invented. Even if you didn&#8217;t smoke, you could not escape those who did!&#8221; says\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8\">John Oliver <\/a>on Last Week Tonight. As Oliver\u00a0points out, smoking was so ubiquitous in the past, particularly in the 1960&#8217;s,\u00a0that it was even in cartoons for children.<\/p>\n<p>John Oliver has started a war against tobacco companies\u00a0with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffwecan\">#JeffWeCan<\/a>\u00a0for\u00a0the absolutely ridiculous burden these companies are putting on countries. Let&#8217;s talk about the undeniable health dangers of smoking that make this fight important.<\/p>\n<p>Smoking is still the leading preventable cause of death in the United States with\u00a0one in five\u00a0deaths\u00a0caused by\u00a0smoking. That&#8217;s more deaths than illegal drugs, alcohol, and driving combined. This is because 90% of lung <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/cancer\/lung\/basic_info\/risk_factors.htm\">cancer deaths<\/a><span style=\"color: #008000;\">\u00a0<\/span>are due to smoking. A general rule of thumb is that smoking pretty much causes cancer everywhere in your body,\u00a0even in the mouth! Oral cancer is one of the devastating results of smoking. This includes cancer of the mouth, lips, tongue and throat. Oral cancer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oralcancerfoundation.org\/facts\/\">kills<\/a>\u00a0about one\u00a0person every hour and 90% of the cause is attributed to tobacco.<\/p>\n<p>Here, in America, we&#8217;ve banned smoking ads, added warning labels to cigarette boxes, and protected the public with limited smoking areas, subsequently reducing smoking rates from almost half the US population in 1965 to 18% . However, tobacco\u00a0companies are earning more than they ever have, banking on human lives around the world. Remember the viral video of the two-year-old baby boy from Indonesia smoking away? He is addicted, and so are\u00a0two-thirds\u00a0of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/tobacco\/surveillance\/policy\/country_profile\/idn.pdf\">adult males<\/a> in that country. Yet, we allow Marlboro advertisements to continue. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a Maybe, be a Marlboro,&#8221; says<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tobaccotactics.org\/index.php\/Be_Marlboro:_Targeting_the_World%27s_Biggest_Brand_at_Youth\">\u00a0tobacco company Philip Morris<\/a>\u00a0with their latest campaign.<\/p>\n<p>And what happens when countries with public health concerns try to protect their citizens through legal actions? When <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ag.gov.au\/tobaccoplainpackaging\">Australia<\/a>\u00a0passed the plain-packaging-law in 2011, replacing ads with gruesome reality of\u00a0health effects, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/life-style\/health-and-families\/health-news\/philip-morris-international-threatens-to-sue-government-if-plain-packaging-introduced-9664968.html\">Philip Morris<\/a> sued the Australian government, saying that \u201cstandardized packaging is a euphemism for government-mandated destruction of property. It is unlawful, disproportionate, and at odds with the most basic requirements of the rule of law.\u201d Fortunately, the law passed because of significant evidence of public health benefits.<\/p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\">\n<div class=\"getty embed image\" style=\"background-color: #fff; display: inline-block; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #a7a7a7; font-size: 11px; width: 100%; max-width: 509px;\">\n<div style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0; text-align: left;\"><a style=\"color: #a7a7a7; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal !important; border: none; display: inline-block;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gettyimages.com\/detail\/545467344\" target=\"_blank\">Embed from Getty Images<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"overflow: hidden; position: relative; height: 0; padding: 66.601179% 0 0 0; width: 100%;\"><iframe style=\"display: inline-block; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0;\" src=\"\/\/embed.gettyimages.com\/embed\/545467344?et=atNBYnpySu9RkY5his7zWQ&amp;viewMoreLink=off&amp;sig=H06ekRGM_Nhg98bM8nRktXgBYXQHeZqMXH_fV3c3p6I=\" width=\"509\" height=\"339\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\">\u00a0Replacing ads with images depicting tobacco&#8217;s damage to health<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Image Source: <a id=\"photographer\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gettyimages.com\/search\/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=1001gece\" data-close-and-redirect=\"true\" data-search-type=\"photographer\">1001gece<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>What about countries who cannot afford that sort of legal cost? Uruguay has a population of 3.5 million and a small cigarette market has been sued by Philip Morris\u00a0for over five years because of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/business\/analysis-and-features\/big-tobacco-puts-countries-on-trial-as-concerns-over-ttip-deals-mount-9807478.html\">health awareness campaigns<\/a>. One of the poorest countries with a Gross Domestic Product\u00a0of 4.3 billion\u00a0is getting sued by the $18 billion dollar multinational Philip Morris for attempting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ictsd.org\/bridges-news\/bridges\/news\/tobacco-company-files-claim-against-uruguay-over-labelling-laws\">to enact plain-packaging-laws<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The solution is definitely not to point fingers at individuals that fall into the trap of systemic and structural failures. The bigger problem is a powerful industry that relentlessly profits off addiction and misinformation.\u00a0There needs to be finances and policies set aside to ensure tobacco farmers abroad are trained with alternative\u00a0profit yielding goods.\u00a0Let&#8217;s dig Philip\u00a0Morris and other cigarette companies a grave and make the horrific crime they&#8217;ve committed to the human race another notorious chapter in world\u00a0history.<\/p>\n<p><em>Feature Image Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/erikbenson\/16390957459\/in\/photolist-qYpWAP-rgiDbp-qi6Rx6-r2P9sm\" target=\"_blank\">Learning about Marlboro&#8217;s new diseased lung logo by Buster Benson <\/a><\/em><\/p>\n
